/**
 * Market Snapshot — MCP tool.
 *
 * The honest as-of read for "what did/does it look like at time T". Wraps
 * `getSnapshot` (domain/analysis) over the federated bar service, and — given a
 * bare symbol instead of a barId — resolves to the FRESHEST source (realtime
 * broker before delayed vendor), so the analyst's natural reach lands on the
 * live price, not a delayed vendor that silently stopped a day behind. That
 * source mis-wiring (analysis CLI defaults to delayed; realtime hid in the
 * trading CLI) is the gap this closes.

      description: `Honest as-of snapshot of a symbol: DATED bars (no lookahead past asOf), the most-recent ACTUAL print (close + vs-prevClose + day high/low + amplitude), a compact technical state (sma20/50, rsi14, distance from period high/low), AND a loud freshness contract.

Use this — not calculateQuant — whenever the question is "what does/did X look like" or "rewind X to a date":
  - "how's XLE right now" → marketSnapshot --query XLE
  - "what did NVDA look like on 2026-04-15" → marketSnapshot --query NVDA --asOf 2026-04-15
Why it beats hand-rolling from quant: quant returns latest scalars with NO dates and CANNOT emit a dated series; snapshot returns the dated path AND guarantees no-lookahead at asOf.

Source: pass a barId (from searchBars) to pin one, OR a bare symbol/query — then it auto-picks the FRESHEST source (realtime broker > delayed vendor). For a vendor symbol you may need asset=.

FRESHNESS IS LOAD-BEARING. The result carries asOf / isLatestActual / staleTradingDays, and a freshnessWarning when the data does not reach the anchor. If isLatestActual is false, the "latest" close is STALE — do not report it as the current price (this is the exact trap that turns an overnight catalyst into a missed/【misread】move). Prefer a realtime broker source for anything time-sensitive.`,
